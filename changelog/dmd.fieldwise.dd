`-preview=fieldwise` is now enabled by default

This fixes a bug that affected some struct comparisons using the `==` operator.
For more information, see [the entry for `-preview=fieldwise` in the 2.085.0
changelog](https://dlang.org/changelog/2.085.0.html#no-cmpsb).

The new `-revert=fieldwise` switch can be used to disable the bug fix and
restore the original behavior of the `==` operator.
